# Automation-with-Cucumber
## Why use Cucumber for Automation:
Cucumber is a popular tool used for behavior-driven development (BDD) and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD) in software development. 
Here are some reasons why Cucumber is a good choice for automation testing:
- Collaboration: Cucumber facilitates collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders by providing a common language that everyone can understand. 
- Easy to understand: Cucumber uses a simple syntax that is easy to read and understand, even for non-technical stakeholders. This makes it easier to create and maintain automated tests.
- Reusability: Cucumber allows you to write reusable test scenarios that can be used for different applications or features. This saves time and effort, as you don't have to write new tests from scratch for every project.
- Automated Testing: Cucumber integrates well with automation testing tools like Selenium, which makes it easy to automate your tests and run them as part of your continuous integration (CI) pipeline.
- Documentation: Cucumber generates documentation for your tests, which helps to keep your tests up-to-date and helps to ensure that everyone understands what the tests are doing.
